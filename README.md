# Data-Mining-for-a-Book-Company

This was a project from my Big Data Analytics. This class consisted of doing smaller "consulting" projects. 

The synopsis of this project was: 
You are a data scientist hired by a book company. The company wants to publish a new book titled “Big
Data Analytics” authored by Jane Doe. The author has two previous books in the areas including data
science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and the new book is going to be her third book. The
book is primarily to be used as a college textbook for senior undergraduate students or 1st/2nd year
graduate students. The book will be published as hardcopy, not ebook. The publisher (book company)
wants to position the price of this new book to be compatible, compared with the other competitors,
which is why they hired you.

Below is the table of contents:
“Big Data Analytics” by Jane Doe (Page count: 372)
- Introduction to Big Data
- Hadoop Distributed File System
- Getting Started with Apache Spark
- Supervised Learning for Big Data
- Clustering for Big Data
- Deep Neural Networks
- Ensemble Learning 

As a data scientist, your task is to first of all collect all the relevant information. You may want to use
web crawling/scraping. You can use a GUI tool or write a Python (or whatever) script. There may exist an
API for this, or even a public data set. There is no single answer regarding the data mining method. No
matter which way you take, you will need to mine information about different books as defined by the
client.
One search keyword may not be sufficient and hence you may end up having multiple data tables per
different search queries and/or search engine you used. Therefore, you may need to merge tables
together. ISBN can serve as a unique identifier (i.e. key value for merge). You may also want to construct
a table for authors and somehow link them with the book table.
Once you have mined all the relevant information, you will then need to produce summary statistics.
Remember, this is an open problem. You are responsible for deciding what kind of information you
would like to report to your client. You may group data by publication year and compute average price;
or plot author experience versus book price curve; there are infinitely many possibilities. Think from the
perspective of your client and try to feed them with relevant information.
